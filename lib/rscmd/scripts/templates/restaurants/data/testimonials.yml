reviews:
  - content: A thumbs up to the people and service at this local, home owned restaurant. And like my sister said, â€œbig things come in small packages.

  - content: A hidden gem in Al Barsha, great indo-Chinese and Thai with a twist, perfect for Indian taste buds. If not for anything else, must visit just for the fried ice-cream truly out of this world and something I haven't eaten before.
