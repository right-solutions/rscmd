title: ABOUT US
sub_title: The best restaurant in the town
description1: We draw upon the lively street food culture - but with a twist.
description2: We bring to you the freshest ingredients and sizzling sauces to play with. Mix and match toppings and sauces to create a bowl which is as snazzy or soulful as you are. Then watch our chefs work their magic in the kitchen. Grade A Choice free-range Eggs, chicken, beef and seafood as well as freshly-grown produce are instrumental to the quality and flavour of our food. Well that and some exotic ingredients and secret spices. ( Shh, donâ€™t tell !! ) We love our woks sizzling and our chow spicy.
